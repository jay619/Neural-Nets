# Neural-Nets
* Implementing Logistic & Linear Regression, Neural net trained with Backpropagation (Classification & Regression) with 2 hidden layers, and Two layer neural net trained with autoencoder from scratch and testing against 3 classification and 3 regression datasets.
* Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
* data_pipeline.py - Used for pre-processing the data along with K-Fold cross validation for testing the model performance
* neural_nets.py - Implementation for Logistic Regreesion, Backpropagation, Autoencoders
* Individual test files for testing differnt datasets on each of the three algorithms
